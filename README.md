# Browserify Vue 

Vuejs npm using browserify

[Browserify](https://github.com/browserify/browserify) is the quickest alternative to webpack as you don't need any configuration to start working to your project.
[Watchify](https://github.com/browserify/watchify) is used to watch on save using browserify. 

Broserify is used here in this repo with [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#NPM)

Install the dependencies and use

```bash
npm run build
```

to build and

``` bash
npm run watch
```

to watch on save
